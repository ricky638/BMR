# AWS Terraform Pipeline – Final Project

This project demonstrates a complete AWS infrastructure deployment using Terraform, including IAM, Lambda, S3, and ECS components. It represents my individual contribution to the group’s serverless image‑processing pipeline.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This repository contains my portion of the IT 261 final project, which includes:

- Terraform configuration files (IAM, Lambda, S3, ECS, variables, etc.)
- Lambda function code
- Documentation files
- Screenshots demonstrating the working pipeline
- Statement of Work and project checklist

The project provisions AWS resources using Terraform, deploys a Lambda function, and demonstrates automated infrastructure deployment.

## 🧩 Presigned URL Generator (Lightweight Lambda)

To support uploading any user‑selected image to the S3 input bucket, the project includes a small Lambda function that generates **pre‑signed S3 URLs** on demand.

This Lambda:

- Runs only when a user uploads a file  
- Executes for a few milliseconds  
- Has negligible cost  
- Does not affect the previously submitted project budget  

It enables the upload page to:

- Request a fresh pre‑signed URL for each file  
- Support any filename and content type  
- Securely upload images to the S3 input bucket  

This is a standard component of S3 upload architecture and ensures the frontend upload tool works reliably.

## 🖼️ S3‑Triggered Lambda: Image Metadata Processor

This Lambda function is the entry point for my portion of the serverless pipeline. It is triggered automatically whenever a new file is uploaded to the designated S3 input bucket.

### **Trigger**
- **Event Source:** `s3:ObjectCreated:*`  
- **Bucket:** Shared input bucket (ARN provided in Terraform variables)

### **Function Responsibilities**
- Parse S3 event notification to extract:
  - Bucket name  
  - Object key  
  - Timestamp  
  - File size  
  - File type  
- Validate uploaded object (image file, non‑zero size)  
- Generate a unique record ID  
- Write a structured item to the shared DynamoDB table (`bmr-dynamodb-table`) including:
  - `id` (UUID)  
  - `filename`  
  - `bucket`  
  - `timestamp`  
  - `filesize`  
  - `filetype`  
  - `status` (“received”)  
  - `notes` (“Initial metadata recorded”)

### **Outputs**
- A DynamoDB record representing the uploaded file  
- CloudWatch logs for debugging and traceability  

### **Why This Matters**
This Lambda establishes the first step in the pipeline and ensures every uploaded file is tracked consistently. It decouples the upload interface from downstream processing, allowing the ECS/Fargate stage to operate independently.
